 * connected. Once a number is linked, its real settings (owner number,
 * owner name, bot name, status emojis, anti-link, etc.) live in
 * sessionSettings.json via library/settingsStore.js, and can be changed
 * any time from the web settings panel. That per-number data always wins
 * over the defaults below.
